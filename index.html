                    Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 â€“ January 7, 1943) was a visionary inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and physicist 
                    whose groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern electrical engineering and technology. His contributions to the fields of 
                    alternating current (AC) electrical systems, radio, and wireless communication have left an indelible mark on the world.

                    Born in Smiljan, Croatia (then part of the Austrian Empire), Tesla displayed extraordinary intelligence and a deep interest in science
                    and engineering from a young age. He studied electrical engineering at the Technical University of Graz and later attended the University of Prague.
